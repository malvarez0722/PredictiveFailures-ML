# PredictiveFailures-ML
#### Description: Predictive modeling of rod pump failures through ML

## Problem Statement
- What production and mechanical parameters are the leading predictors for rod pump failure/downtime? 
- What is best design?

## Business Impact
- An unexpected rod pump outage can drastically reduce production capacity and can significantly increase lifting costs. 
- Businesses can use our real-time anomaly detection technology to become aware and proactive of potential repairs when such anomalies are detected.

## Solution
This solution consists in developing statistical models using Machine Learning in order to identify, diagnose and predict failures and downtime errors for rod pumps.
